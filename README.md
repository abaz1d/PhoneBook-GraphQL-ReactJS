# PhoneBook-GraphQL-Sequelize-ReactJS

## Introduction

This is a simple full stack React application which provides a solid starting point for [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/), [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) based applications. Client side code is written in React and the backend API is written using Express.

A phone book is a book containing the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of telephone subscribers in a particular area. A telephone book publisher is a telecommunications service company or telephone information service provider.

* Express - The best way to understand express is through it's [Official Website](https://expressjs.com/), which has a [Getting Started](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html) guide, as well as an [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html) guide for general express topics.
* ReactJS - React's [Official Website](https://reactjs.org/) is a great starting point.
* Node.js - Start by going through [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org/en/) which should get you going with the Node.js platform.
